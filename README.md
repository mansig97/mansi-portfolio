# ✨ Mansi Gangurde – Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Framer Motion**. It showcases who I am, the cloud projects I build, and the chaos I turn into clean, scalable infrastructure ☁️.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Framer Motion**
- **ShadCN UI**
- Deployed via [coming soon: AWS Amplify / S3 + CloudFront]

## 🚀 Features

- Hero banner with interactive animations
- About Me section with personality (and sarcasm)
- Skills, Resume, Contact section
- Project gallery linking to GitHub repos
- Fun AI-disclaimer because yes, I use AI smartly

🧠 Why This Matters
Yes, I took AI’s help to build this. But the ideas, design, layout, vibe — all reflect me.
I know what I’m doing, I’m proud of it, and I’m just getting started. 😎
